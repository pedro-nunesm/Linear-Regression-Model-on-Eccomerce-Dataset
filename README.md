# Linear Regression Model on Eccomerce Database



### The goal of this project is help an Eccomerce to make a better investment decision, seeking a greater amount spent annually per customer.
### For this, I will use the Linear Regression Machine Learning model.


## 1- Business Problem
I'm supposedly helping out an e-commerce company based in New York City that sells clothes online, but also has in-store style and apparel consulting sessions. Customers walk into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then go home and order from a mobile app or website for the outfit they want.


The company is trying to decide whether to focus its efforts on mobile apps or its website. And for that, I'll implement a Machine Learning model to make the best decision based on data.




## 2- Solution
 **Step I** - Import Libraries;
 
 **Step II** - Load dataset (provided by ASIMOV ACADEMY);
 
 **Step III** - Analyze how the data is distributed;
 
 **Step IV** - Find correlation between the variables .
 
 **Step V** - Implement the Linear Regression Model
 
 **Step VI** - Test the prediction and compare with data test;
 
 **Step VII** - Evaluate the model using using metrics to measure errors;
 
 **Step VIII** - Make a conclusion
